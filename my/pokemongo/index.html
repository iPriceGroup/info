                <p>How Big is the Pokémon Go phenomenon in Malaysia?</p>
                <span>
                    On the 6th July 2016, Pokemon Go was released with many eager fans  waiting to have a go at it (no pun intended). Since then, the app has garnered millions of users worldwide, surpassing the daily active Twitter users. As the app made its debut in Malaysia on 6th August, we made an analysis to visualize how big this phenomenon is to date. The analysis was done by comparing volume of online searches in relation to other recent major local and international topics which sparked Malaysian's interest.
