                <p>How Big is the Pokémon Go phenomenon in Malaysia?</p>
                <span>
                    On the 6th of July 2016, Pokémon Go was released with many eager fans waiting in the tall green grasses. Since then, the app has garnered millions of users worldwide, even surpassing Twitter for daily active users. While the app has yet to make its debut in Malaysia, that hasn’t stopped it from sparking major interest amongst the locals. To see just how big this phenomenon is, we have made some data comparisons with the volume of online searches related to other major local and international events of recent history.
