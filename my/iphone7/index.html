                    <span>
                        The cost of the new iPhone 7 is significantly more expensive compared to the US. Reasons for this difference in pricing range from export/import costs, tax and fees imposed by the countries respective governments.
                        <br><br>In countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines, where the iPhone 7 has yet to be officially launched, Apple enthusiasts have resorted to getting the phone from abroad in the hope of being one of the first to own the phone. Unauthorized retailers are purchasing this latest model from countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, where it has been officially launched. The phones are then re-sold in their respective countries at higher prices, which can go up by 14% in Vietnam and by 49% in Thailand (refer to infographics).

                        Listed as the 2nd least hardest country to afford for the new iPhones, the new smartphones is still quite costly to Malaysians. With access to a great variety of Android phones and with many Malaysians still owning previous generations of the iPhone, there is a possibility of a lower reception for the new device.
                        Though just a few kilometres away from Singapore, Malaysia unfortunately was not included in the first round of Apple’s global product distribution as well. Rumoured to arrive late October 2016, majority reception of the new iPhone by members of media was mostly neutral or negative. Nevertheless, Malaysia is expected to see great reception on the new smartphone, similar to its neighbouring country. However, there isn’t a good benchmark to truly gauge if the new iPhone will be as popular as its predecessors.
